GitHub is a web-based platform that integrates Git, a distributed version control system, with tools for collaboration, project management, and automation. It is widely used by developers to host, manage, and share code repositories, making it a cornerstone of modern software development.

Key Features of GitHub

GitHub offers several features that enhance productivity and collaboration:

Version Control: Tracks changes to code, allowing developers to revert to previous versions and collaborate without overwriting each other's work.

Repositories: Central storage for project files and their version history. Repositories can be public or private.

Branches: Enable parallel development by allowing developers to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

Pull Requests: Facilitate code reviews and collaboration by proposing changes to a repository.

Issues and Labels: Help track bugs, enhancements, and tasks, with labels for categorization.

GitHub Actions: Automate workflows like testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.

Forking and Cloning: Forking creates a copy of a repository for independent development, while cloning downloads a repository for local work.
